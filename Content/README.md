Crisis Text Line (CTL) is a global non-profit organization that provides free, 24/7 mental health support via text message. A human, volunteer Crisis Counselor receives the opening text message and responds from a secure platform. Crisis Counselors are trained to provide empathy and resources to help a person in a mental health crisis de-escalate from a "hot" to "cool" moment.

## My Volunteer Story
I started as a volunteer CTL Crisis Counselor in 2020 while stuck at home during the pandemic shutdown. Upon completion of a two-month training period, I began facilitating text conversations with hundreds of people. This is not an easy or lighthearted volunteer position, but it is rewarding and educational. I am sincerely grateful for the people and experiences that have given me the tools and oppotunities to become emotionally intelligent and change lives for the better.

## Volunteer Work Samples
In addition to being a Cisis Counselor, I have used my professional communication and technical skills to help create web designs, emails, and instructional materials for my fellow CTL volunteers. You can view samples of them by clicking on the Design and Writing folders.
