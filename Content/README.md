Crisis Text Line (CTL) is a global non-profit organization that provides free, 24/7 mental health support via text message. A human, volunteer Crisis Counselor receives the opening text message and responds from a secure platform. Crisis Counselors are trained to provide empathy and resources to help a person in a mental health crisis de-escalate from a "hot" to "cool" moment.

## What CTL means to me
I started as a volunteer CTL Crisis Counselor in 2020 while stuck at home during the pandemic shutdown. Upon completion of a two-month training period, I began facilitating text conversations with hundreds of people. This is not an easy or lighthearted volunteer position, but it is rewarding and educational. I am sincerely grateful for the people and experiences that have given me the tools and oppotunities to become emotionally intelligent and change lives for the better.

In addition to being a Cisis Counselor, I have used my professional communication and technical skills to help create web designs, emails, and instructional materials for my fellow CTL volunteers.
